<p>This package contains classes that can be used to implement
a proxying Radius server using TinyRadius.</p>

<p>In addition to the abstract methods from RadiusServer, you
have to override the method getProxyServer() from RadiusProxy
in order to determine which packets shall be proxied and to
which proxy server they will be sent.</p>
